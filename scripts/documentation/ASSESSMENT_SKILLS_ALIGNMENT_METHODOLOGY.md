## Core Methodology

### **Principle: Skills Must Align With What's Actually Tested**

Traditional approach (WRONG):
```
Create broad skills → Hope they align with assessment
```

**Assessment-Skills Alignment approach (CORRECT):**
```
Analyze assessment questions → Extract tested skills → Create aligned content
```

### **The Fundamental Rule**
> **Every skill must directly correspond to a specific type of question being tested in the assessment.**

### **Core Components**
1. **Assessment Question Analysis** - What specific skills are being tested?
2. **Skills Extraction** - What are the distinct skills being measured?
3. **Content Alignment** - Do insights and actions match the tested skill?
4. **Strength/Weakness Logic** - What happens when someone scores high/low?
5. **Action Relevance** - Do actions help improve the specific tested skill?

---

## Assessment Analysis Process

### Step 1: Question Inventory
**Process:** Catalog every assessment question and analyze what skill it tests

**Example from Core I Assessment:**
```
Question: "How should you listen as Sarah shares this emotional career setback?"
Options:
A) Focus on how her story relates to your own career disappointments
B) Listen deeply to both her words and the emotions behind them ✓
C) Consider what her colleagues might think about her situation  
D) Think about advice you could give her about job searching

SKILL BEING TESTED: Emotional Attunement
SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR: Listening to words AND emotions simultaneously
```

### Step 2: Skill Pattern Recognition
**Process:** Group questions that test the same underlying skill

**Example Pattern:**
- Sarah question (emotional career setback) → Emotional Attunement
- Marcus question (juggling decisions) → Reflective Listening
- Kevin question (vulnerability) → Safety & Trust Building

**Result:** 3 distinct Active Listening skills being tested

### Step 3: Competency Mapping
**Process:** Ensure skills map correctly to competencies

**Core I Example:**
- **Active Listening:** 5 questions → 3 distinct skills
- **Powerful Questions:** 5 questions → 3 distinct skills  
- **Present Moment Awareness:** 5 questions → 3 distinct skills

### Step 4: Gap Analysis
**Process:** Identify skills being tested but not in current skill set

**Example Gap Found:**
- **Trust & Safety Building** was being tested (Kevin question) but we had no specific skill for it
- **Empowering Questions** was being tested (Carlos question) but was buried in generic categories

---

## Skills Extraction Framework

### **Formula for Skills Identification**

```
Assessment Question → Correct Answer → Underlying Skill → Skills Tag
```

**Example Walkthrough:**

**Question:** "Which question would best help Jennifer connect with what truly matters to her?"
**Correct Answer:** "What matters most to you about how you want to spend your professional life?"
**Underlying Skill:** Values-Based Questioning
**Skills Tag:** "Values-Based Questions"

### **Skills Naming Convention**

**Format:** `[Core Behavior] + [Context/Method]`

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Reflective Listening" (behavior + method)
- ✅ "Values-Based Questions" (context + behavior)
- ✅ "Energy Awareness" (focus + behavior)
- ❌ "Good Listening" (too vague)
- ❌ "Advanced Questioning" (no specific behavior)

### **Skills Distinctiveness Test**

Each skill must pass these tests:
1. **Unique Question Pattern:** Does it correspond to a specific type of question?
2. **Distinct Behavior:** Is the required behavior different from other skills?
3. **Measurable Outcome:** Can you tell if someone is good/bad at this specific skill?
4. **Actionable Improvement:** Can you give specific advice to improve this skill?

---

## Content Creation Standards

### **Content Alignment Rule**
> **All content (insights and actions) must directly relate to the specific skill being tested in the assessment.**

### **Content Creation Process**

#### For Each Skill:
1. **Review Assessment Questions** that test this skill
2. **Identify Success Patterns** (what good performance looks like)
3. **Identify Failure Patterns** (what poor performance looks like)  
4. **Create Aligned Content** that addresses these specific patterns

#### **Example: Reflective Listening**

**Assessment Questions Testing This:**
- "How do you best reflect back what you're hearing from Marcus?"
- Correct answer: "What I'm hearing is that you're juggling multiple major decisions while feeling financial pressure."

**Success Pattern:** Reflecting both content AND emotional undertones
**Failure Pattern:** Missing emotional undertones, only reflecting facts

**Aligned Content:**
- **Weakness Insight:** "Missing emotional undertones when reflecting back client sharing"
- **Strength Insight:** "Strong at reflecting both content and emotional undertones"  
- **Action:** "Practice: 'What I heard is [content] and it sounds like you're feeling [emotion]'"

### **Content Quality Standards**

#### **Weakness Insights:**
- ✅ Specific to the tested skill
- ✅ Describes what goes wrong when skill is lacking
- ✅ Connects to assessment question failure patterns
- ❌ Generic statements that could apply to any skill

#### **Strength Insights:**
- ✅ Specific to the tested skill
- ✅ Describes what success looks like for this skill
- ✅ Connects to assessment question success patterns
- ❌ Generic praise that could apply to anyone

#### **Actions:**
- ✅ Directly improves the specific tested skill
- ✅ Concrete, actionable steps
- ✅ Beginner-friendly language
- ✅ Can be practiced immediately
- ❌ Vague advice that doesn't specify how to improve

### **Professional Coaching Language Standards** (Updated August 2025)

#### **CRITICAL: All content must use professional coaching terminology**

**Language Requirements for Credibility:**
- Content must sound appropriate for ICF-certified professional coaches
- Avoid mystical, spiritual, or "new age" terminology
- Focus on evidence-based coaching practices
- Use industry-standard coaching language

**APPROVED Professional Terms:**
- "resourceful state" (not "wisdom" or "inner knowing")
- "awareness" and "insights" (not "profound truths")
- "skills" and "capability" (not "mastery" unless exceptional)
- "powerful experiences" (not "transformational experiences")
- "access their thinking" (not "tap into wisdom")
- "breakthrough moments" (acceptable coaching term)

**FORBIDDEN Mystical Language:**
- ❌ "wisdom," "inner wisdom," "ancient wisdom"
- ❌ "profound truths," "deepest truths," "spiritual insights"
- ❌ "transformational," "transcendent," "mystical"
- ❌ "inner voice," "soul," "spirit," "divine"
- ❌ "chakras," "energy healing," "vibrations"

**Tone Requirements:**
- **Growth-oriented:** Focus on development, not criticism
- **Encouraging:** Acknowledge progress while identifying growth areas
- **Professional:** Maintain coaching industry credibility
- **Practical:** Emphasize immediately applicable techniques

**Content Independence Rule:**
- Strategic actions must NOT reference assessment scenarios
- No mentions of "Marcus," "Sarah," "Jennifer," etc. from assessment questions
- Actions should be original coaching techniques, not assessment explanations
- Each piece of content must provide unique, non-repetitive value

## Life Area Balance Framework
*Added August 2025 - Core II Intermediate Learning*

### **The Life Context Principle**
> **Coaching skills must be tested across diverse life contexts to ensure realistic applicability and inclusive assessment.**

### **Wheel of Life Distribution Standard**

**Problem Identified:** Early assessments over-focused on work/career contexts (60%+), limiting:
- Real-world applicability for diverse coaching practices
- Cultural inclusiveness and scenario relatability  
- Skill transfer validation beyond business contexts

**Solution:** Balanced life area distribution for comprehensive skill validation

### **Recommended Distribution (26-question assessment):**

#### **Primary Life Areas (70% of questions):**
- **Career/Work:** 23% (6 questions) - Professional boundaries, leadership, workplace dynamics
- **Relationships:** 23% (6 questions) - Romantic (2), Family (2), Friendships (2)  
- **Health & Fitness:** 15% (4 questions) - Physical health (2), Mental health (2)
- **Personal Growth:** 15% (4 questions) - Identity, self-development, emotional patterns

#### **Secondary Life Areas (30% of questions):**
- **Finance:** 8% (2 questions) - Money behaviors, financial planning anxiety
- **Fun & Recreation:** 8% (2 questions) - Creativity, leisure guilt, play
- **Environment:** 8% (2 questions) - Living space, community, belonging

### **Implementation Guidelines**

#### **Scenario Development Rules:**
1. **Skill-First Approach:** Choose life area AFTER determining what skill to test
2. **Authentic Client Language:** Use realistic client quotes, not theoretical descriptions
3. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Avoid assumptions about values, family structures, or cultural norms
4. **Professional Boundaries:** All scenarios must remain within coaching scope (not therapy)

#### **Context Rotation Strategy:**
```
Assessment Level → Life Area Emphasis
Beginner → 40% Work, 30% Relationships, 30% Personal Growth (foundational skills)
Intermediate → 23% Work, 46% Relationships+Health, 31% Growth+Recreation (complexity)
Advanced → 20% Work, 50% Complex Relationships+Community, 30% Leadership+Systems (sophistication)
```

#### **Quality Checks:**
- [ ] No single life area exceeds 30% of total questions
- [ ] Scenarios reflect diverse professional backgrounds (not just executives)
- [ ] Relationship scenarios include various relationship types
- [ ] Health scenarios balance physical and mental wellness
- [ ] Financial scenarios avoid economic assumptions
- [ ] Recreation scenarios validate non-productivity values

### **Benefits Validated:**
✅ **Broader Applicability** - Skills transfer across coaching niches  
✅ **Inclusive Assessment** - Resonates with diverse coaching populations  
✅ **Realistic Preparation** - Reflects actual coaching practice diversity  
✅ **Skill Validation** - Tests coaching competencies in varied contexts

## Strength/Weakness Logic

### **Performance-Based Content Delivery**

**The System Logic:**
```
User Assessment Score → Performance Analysis → Appropriate Content
```

### **Scoring Thresholds** (to be refined based on data)
- **Strength:** ≥70% correct on skill-related questions
- **Weakness:** <70% correct on skill-related questions

### **Content Delivery Logic**

#### **When User Shows STRENGTH (≥70%):**
- **Display:** Strength insight
- **Purpose:** Reinforce what they're doing well
- **Action Focus:** How to leverage this strength further
- **Tone:** Affirming and building

**Example:**
```
Skill: Emotional Attunement
Score: 80% (4/5 questions correct)
Insight: "Your sensitivity to emotional nuances and ability to reflect feelings back to clients helps them develop greater awareness and process complex feelings safely."
Action: "Continue reflecting both content and emotions. Try: 'I hear [fact] and sense [feeling]'"
```

#### **When User Shows WEAKNESS (<70%):**
- **Display:** Weakness insight  
- **Purpose:** Identify what needs improvement
- **Action Focus:** How to develop this skill
- **Tone:** Constructive and developmental

**Example:**
```
Skill: Emotional Attunement  
Score: 40% (2/5 questions correct)
Insight: "Missing emotional content while focusing primarily on facts."
Action: "Practice listening for feeling words: 'I notice you said frustrated - tell me more about that feeling.'"
```

### **Dual Content Requirement**

**Every skill MUST have:**
1. **Weakness insight** + **weakness-focused action**
2. **Strength insight** + **strength-focused action**

**Why both are needed:**
- Different users will have different performance levels
- Same user may be strong in some skills, weak in others
- Content must be relevant to actual performance

---

## Action Association Rules

### **Action-Performance Alignment**

**Rule:** Actions must be specifically designed for the user's performance level on that skill.

#### **Weakness Actions (Developmental)**
- **Purpose:** Help user improve from current weak performance
- **Focus:** Basic skill building
- **Tone:** Step-by-step guidance
- **Complexity:** Simple, immediately actionable

**Example:**
```
Skill: Values-Based Questions (Weakness)
Action: "Start with: 'What's most important to you about [situation]?' Practice asking this in 3 conversations this week."
```

#### **Strength Actions (Leveraging)**  
- **Purpose:** Help user leverage existing strength
- **Focus:** Advanced application and refinement
- **Tone:** Building on existing competence
- **Complexity:** More sophisticated techniques

**Example:**
```
Skill: Values-Based Questions (Strength)  
Action: "Since you're skilled at values questions, try layering: 'What's most important about X?' then 'What makes that important to you?' to go deeper."
```

### **Action Specificity Requirements**

#### **Must Include:**
- ✅ Specific words/phrases to use
- ✅ Clear behavioral steps
- ✅ Practice suggestions
- ✅ Immediate applicability

#### **Must Avoid:**
- ❌ Vague advice ("be more present")
- ❌ Assumptions about prior knowledge
- ❌ Complex multi-step processes (for weakness actions)
- ❌ Generic coaching advice

### **Action Testing Framework**

**Question:** Could a complete beginner follow this action and improve at the specific skill being tested?

**Example Testing:**
```
Action: "Practice saying: 'What I heard you say is...' and include both facts and feelings."

Test Questions:
- Is it specific? ✅ (exact words provided)
- Is it actionable? ✅ (clear behavior to practice)  
- Does it improve the tested skill? ✅ (directly improves reflective listening)
- Can a beginner do it? ✅ (no prior skills assumed)

RESULT: ✅ GOOD ACTION
```

```
Action: "Set intention before sessions: approach with curiosity, not judgment."

Test Questions:
- Is it specific? ❌ (how do you "set intention"?)
- Is it actionable? ❌ (no clear behavior specified)
- Does it improve the tested skill? ❌ (too general)
- Can a beginner do it? ❌ (assumes knowledge of intention-setting)

RESULT: ❌ BAD ACTION (needs revision)
```
