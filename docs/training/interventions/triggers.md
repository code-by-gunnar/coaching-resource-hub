# Recurring negative image or trigger

### 🔎 Client Situation: Recurring Negative Image or Trigger

The client experiences involuntary mental imagery, flashbacks, or emotional responses triggered by a specific event, fear, or self-perception. This can include fear of public speaking, a haunting memory, or a mental “loop” of failure or shame.

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. NLP Swish Pattern**

- *How:* Identify the negative image the client sees. Help them design a positive, empowering image they want instead. Use rapid visualization “swish” reps to replace the old image with the new one.
- *When:* When a specific mental image or scenario keeps playing and triggering anxiety, shame, or fear.

**2. Re-imprinting (NLP Advanced)**

- *How:* Support client in revisiting a past memory with their current adult resources. Add a new character, resource, or wisdom. Shift the emotional tone of the memory.
- *When:* When the image is tied to a limiting belief or unresolved emotional experience.

**3. Visualization Reframe**

- *How:* Have the client replay the image in a silly or distorted way (e.g., cartoon filter, fast-forward, reverse). Helps reduce emotional intensity.
- *When:* When the image is distressing but not traumatic.

**4. Anchoring a Resource State**

- *How:* Build a strong, positive state (confidence, calm) and anchor it physically. Help the client activate this anchor when the trigger shows up.
- *When:* To interrupt the trigger with an emotional shift.

**5. Parts Work**

- *How:* Explore what part of the client keeps showing this image and what it’s trying to protect. Dialogue with it. Acknowledge and negotiate new behavior.
- *When:* When the image feels like a “message” from within.

**6. Somatic Discharge Techniques**

- *How:* Help client move or release the energy linked to the image (e.g., shake, breathe, tap).
- *When:* When the image creates a body reaction (tight chest, shallow breath, etc.).

**7. Future Image Installation**

- *How:* Have the client create and vividly rehearse a new mental image of success or peace in the same context. Make it multisensory.
- *When:* To replace the trigger with a confidence blueprint.

**8. Thought-Image Mapping**

- *How:* Track what thoughts arise with the image. Challenge the thoughts and rewrite them with the client.
- *When:* When the image is linked to automatic negative thoughts.

**9. Metaphor or Story Reframe**

- *How:* Ask: “If this image were a story or symbol, what is it trying to show you?” Explore alternative meanings or endings.
- *When:* When the client resonates with symbolic or creative approaches.
