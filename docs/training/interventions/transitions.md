### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Transition Timeline**

- *How:* Create a visual or written timeline showing life before, during, and after the transition. Reflect on what’s ending, what’s emerging, and what’s unknown.
- *When:* To bring clarity, acknowledge emotions, and create a sense of movement.

**2. Life Chapter Reframing**

- *How:* Frame the transition as the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. Ask: “What title would you give this new chapter?”
- *When:* When the client is resisting or grieving change.

**3. Identity Check-In**

- *How:* Explore how the client’s identity is shifting (e.g., “Who am I now?”). Ask: “What parts of you are evolving? What’s staying true?”
- *When:* During transitions that redefine roles or sense of self (e.g., new parent, retiree).

**4. Emotional Acknowledgment and Space**

- *How:* Create space to name and normalize mixed emotions: grief, fear, guilt, relief, hope.
- *When:* When the client feels emotionally overwhelmed or stuck.

**5. Strengths Reflection**

- *How:* Explore previous transitions the client has navigated. What strengths helped them then? How might those support them now?
- *When:* To build self-trust and resilience.

**6. Support Mapping**

- *How:* Identify sources of support (people, practices, communities). Ask: “Who or what can support you through this change?”
- *When:* When the client feels isolated or ungrounded.

**7. Values Alignment Check**

- *How:* Clarify which values the transition supports or challenges. Ask: “What value do you want to stay connected to during this time?”
- *When:* When motivation or meaning feels unclear.

**8. Future Vision Anchoring**

- *How:* Guide the client to visualize life 3–6 months post-transition. Ask: “What do you want to be true then?”
- *When:* When the future feels uncertain or too far away.

**9. Ritual or Release Practice**

- *How:* Encourage the client to symbolically release what’s ending (e.g., writing a letter, closing a journal, creating a ceremony).
- *When:* When the client is holding onto a past version of life or self.

**10. Small Wins Strategy**

- *How:* Break down goals into simple next steps. Celebrate tiny wins to build confidence through transition.
- *When:* When progress feels daunting or stalled.
