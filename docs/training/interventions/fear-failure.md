# Fear of failure or taking risks

### 🔎 Client Situation: Stuck in Negative Self-Talk / Fear of Failure or Taking Risks

*Client struggles with self-criticism, fear of judgment, perfectionism, or avoids action due to fear of failing or not being good enough.*

---

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Cognitive Reframing**

- *How:* Challenge unhelpful beliefs and thoughts. Ask: “What’s another way to look at this?” or “What would you tell a friend in the same situation?”
- *When:* When the client uses language like “I can’t,” “I’m not good enough,” or “I always mess up.”

**2. Inner Critic vs. Inner Coach**

- *How:* Identify the voice of the inner critic. Introduce the voice of an “inner coach” who is supportive, encouraging, and grounded.
- *When:* When negative internal dialogue blocks confidence and clarity.

**3. Fear-Setting (Tim Ferriss-style)**

- *How:* Explore the worst-case scenario: What is the worst that could happen? How could you prevent or recover from it? What would you gain if you tried?
- *When:* When fear of failure prevents action.

**4. Evidence Building (Self-Trust Stack)**

- *How:* List past wins, strengths, and moments where the client overcame fear. Ask: “What’s your track record of learning from challenges?”
- *When:* When self-talk is disconnected from reality or overly harsh.

**5. Identity-Based Reframing**

- *How:* Focus on who the client wants to become, not just what they want to do. Ask: “What would a confident version of you do in this moment?”
- *When:* When motivation is tied to fear of not being ‘enough.’

**6. Success & Failure Redefinition**

- *How:* Ask the client to define what success and failure truly mean. Explore how growth, learning, and experimentation fit in.
- *When:* When black-and-white thinking about failure is present.

**7. Future Self Perspective**

- *How:* Invite the client to visualize their future self, having taken the risk. Ask: “What would they say to you now?”
- *When:* When fear dominates their decision-making.

**8. Thought Awareness Practice**

- *How:* Bring attention to the self-talk loop. Have the client write down or say out loud their thoughts. Then question: “Is this true? Helpful? Yours?”
- *When:* When thoughts are automatic and unexamined.

**9. Role Reversal or Modeling**

- *How:* Have them imagine someone they admire in the same situation. Ask: “What would they think, say, or do?”
- *When:* To interrupt habitual fear patterns with external inspiration.

**10. Affirmation + Action Combo**

- *How:* Create a personalized affirmation and pair it with a small courageous action. Build new evidence through movement.
- *When:* When thought alone isn’t shifting the state.

### 🔎 Powerful Coaching Questions

- “What is your inner critic saying right now? Whose voice does it sound like?”
- “What’s the cost of believing this thought?”
- “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?”
- “What’s the smallest brave action you can take today?”
- “How would you speak to a close friend in your shoes?”

**Tip:** Help your client recognize that fear is a normal part of growth. The goal isn't to eliminate fear or self-doubt — it's to move forward *with* it using tools that build confidence and truth.
