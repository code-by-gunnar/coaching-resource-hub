# Struggling with self-confidence

### 🔎 Client Situation: Struggling with Self-Confidence

The client lacks belief in their abilities, second-guesses themselves, or avoids taking action due to fear of failure, judgment, or unworthiness. This can show up in work, relationships, communication, or personal growth.
