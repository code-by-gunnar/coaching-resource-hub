# Inner conflict or ambivalence

### 🔎 Client Situation: Inner Conflict or Ambivalence

*Client feels torn between two choices, desires, or internal voices (e.g., “part of me wants this, but part of me doesn’t”). This may result in confusion, paralysis, or self-sabotage.*

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Parts Work (Internal Dialogue)**

- *How:* Help the client name each “part” (e.g., the Achiever vs. the Protector). Give each a voice and explore what it wants, fears, and needs.
- *When:* When the client is emotionally torn or speaks in “parts language.”

**2. Chair Work (Gestalt Technique)**

- *How:* Use two chairs to represent each part. Have the client physically move between them and speak from each perspective.
- *When:* When embodiment or role-play helps externalize the conflict.

**3. Meta-Position / Observer Role**

- *How:* Guide the client to imagine stepping outside of both parts. From this neutral place, ask: “What do you notice about the two sides?”
- *When:* To create clarity and reduce emotional reactivity.

**4. Values Alignment Check**

- *How:* Explore which values are driving each side. Ask: “What value is each part trying to protect or fulfill?”
- *When:* When internal conflict is about what’s ‘right’ or meaningful.

**5. Cost–Benefit Exploration**

- *How:* Make a 2-column list for each side: Benefits and Costs. Compare.
- *When:* When logic helps break down emotional confusion.

**6. Future Self Perspective**

- *How:* Guide the client to visualize their future self after choosing either option. Explore: “What do you see, feel, or regret?”
- *When:* When ambivalence is based in fear of future outcomes.

**7. Embodiment / Somatic Exploration**

- *How:* Ask: “Where do you feel each part in your body?” Let each speak or move. Invite body awareness to lead insight.
- *When:* When verbal processing isn’t bringing resolution.

**8. Decision Rehearsal**

- *How:* Have the client “act as if” they’ve made the decision for 24–48 hours. Reflect afterward.
- *When:* When overthinking stalls progress.

**9. Visual Mapping of the Conflict**

- *How:* Create a diagram or draw both sides of the conflict. Explore overlaps, tensions, and desired outcomes.
- *When:* For visual or reflective clients.

**10. Self-Compassion Dialogue**

- *How:* Acknowledge the difficulty of holding opposing truths. Ask: “What would compassion say to both parts?”
- *When:* When ambivalence leads to shame or frustration.

### 🔎 Powerful Coaching Questions

**Tip:** Ambivalence is not indecision — it's insight waiting to be integrated. Help the client listen to all parts with respect, then choose with clarity.
