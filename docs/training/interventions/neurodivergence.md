# Neurodivergence

### 🔎 Client Situation: Neurodivergent Identity (ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, etc.)

*Client identifies as neurodivergent or is exploring a recent diagnosis/suspected diagnosis. They may be navigating overwhelm, burnout, masking, low self-esteem, or uncertainty around how to work with their natural wiring.*

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Strength-Based Coaching**

- *How:* Focus on what works *because* of their neurodivergence (e.g., creativity, hyperfocus, deep empathy). Ask: “What unique strengths come with your brain wiring?”
- *When:* When the client feels broken or deficient.

**2. Energy & Sensory Mapping**

- *How:* Identify sensory needs, stimulation triggers, and energy cycles. Use this to shape routines and environments.
- *When:* When overstimulation, shutdowns, or energy crashes occur.

**3. Executive Function Support**

- *How:* Offer tools for planning, initiation, and memory (timers, visual cues, external prompts, body doubling).
- *When:* When tasks are hard to start, organize, or remember.

**4. Self-Compassion & De-Masking Work**

- *How:* Explore where they feel they have to “perform” or “pass.” Ask: “What parts of you are tired of hiding?”
- *When:* When client experiences burnout or chronic self-judgment.

**5. Environment and Routine Design**

- *How:* Collaboratively build systems that suit the client's natural rhythms. Focus on *what works*, not what “should” work.
- *When:* When traditional time or task management systems have failed.

**6. Values-Based Goal Setting**

- *How:* Anchor goals to the client’s authentic values. Ask: “What does success look like for *you*?”
- *When:* When societal expectations cloud their vision.

**7. Flexible Accountability Structures**

- *How:* Use compassionate check-ins, gamified progress tracking, or shared wins journal. Adjust to avoid shame.
- *When:* When motivation is inconsistent or shame blocks follow-through.

**8. Identity Empowerment**

- *How:* Support the client in rewriting their story: “I’m not broken — I’m different.” Encourage advocacy and boundary setting.
- *When:* When the client struggles with belonging, self-worth, or diagnosis integration.

**9. Emotional Regulation Support**

- *How:* Explore grounding, sensory tools, co-regulation practices, or body-based cues.
- *When:* When emotions feel overwhelming or dysregulating.

**10. Anti-Perfectionism Reframe**

- *How:* Shift focus from perfection to progress. Ask: “What’s *good enough* to move forward today?”
- *When:* When internalized expectations cause paralysis or self-criticism.

### 🔎 Powerful Coaching Questions

- “What works best for *your* brain?”
- “Where are you still trying to fit into someone else’s system?”
- “What do you need less of — not more of — to function well?”
- “What rules or routines are you ready to redesign around your neurodivergence?”
- “What would radical self-trust look like for you?”

**Tip:** Neurodivergent clients thrive with acceptance, flexibility, and creative support. Your job as coach is to help them build a life that works *with*, not against, their natural wiring.
