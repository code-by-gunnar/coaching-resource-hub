# Overwhelmed by too many options

### 🔎 Client Situation: Overwhelmed by Too Many Options

*Client feels stuck or paralyzed because there are too many possible paths, choices, or decisions to make. May fear making the wrong choice or feel unclear on priorities.*

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Decision Filter (Values-Based)**

- *How:* Identify 2–3 core values. Evaluate each option against those values. Ask: “Which of these feels most aligned with who you are and what matters most to you?”
- *When:* When client needs a values-led path forward.

**2. Priority Mapping (Urgency vs. Importance)**

- *How:* Use the Eisenhower Matrix or a visual grid to plot options based on importance and urgency.
- *When:* When client struggles to organize options clearly.

**3. “Hell Yes or No” Rule (Clarity Filter)**

- *How:* Ask: “Is this a full-body yes or a maybe?” Use gut-checks to eliminate lukewarm options.
- *When:* When client is overthinking or unsure what truly excites them.

**4. Option Collapsing (Bundling & Grouping)**

- *How:* Group similar options together into categories. Ask: “What’s the essence of each group?”
- *When:* When too many similar options create confusion.

**5. Future Visualization**

- *How:* Guide the client to imagine having chosen each option. Explore: “How do you feel living that choice?”
- *When:* When the client needs to engage intuition and emotional alignment.

**6. Elimination Strategy (What Not to Choose)**

- *How:* Ask: “Which of these do you already know is a no?” Eliminate obvious misfits to reduce clutter.
- *When:* When client gets clearer about what they *don’t* want first.

**7. Decision Deadline or Timeboxing**

- *How:* Set a deadline or a 24-hour window to choose. Add accountability.
- *When:* When perfectionism or over-analysis delays progress.

**8. Mind Map or Visual Spread**

- *How:* Create a visual layout of options. Use mind mapping or sticky notes to organize and reflect.
- *When:* When client is a visual learner or nonlinear thinker.

**9. Ask “What’s the Cost of Not Choosing?”**

- *How:* Explore the impact of indecision. Ask: “What’s the cost of staying stuck here another month?”
- *When:* When the client resists decision-making out of fear.

**10. Choose, Test, Adjust**

- *How:* Reinforce that most choices can be adjusted. Encourage experimentation: “Try one for a week. Then review.”
- *When:* When fear of permanence is keeping them from acting.
