# Wants to feel confident, relaxed, or resourceful in specific situations

### 🔎 Client Situation: Wants to Feel Confident, Relaxed, or Resourceful in Specific Situations

The client wants to access a particular emotional or mental state (e.g., confidence before a presentation, calm in high-stress meetings, or resourcefulness during problem-solving).

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. NLP Anchoring**

- *How:* Guide the client to recall a moment when they felt truly confident/relaxed/resourceful. Help them vividly associate with that state (visuals, sounds, emotions), and then “anchor” it with a unique physical action (e.g., pressing two fingers together). Repeat to strengthen the anchor.
- *When:* Ideal before events where they want quick access to an empowered state (e.g., before a job interview or speech).

**2. Future Pacing**

- *How:* After creating a resourceful state or anchor, have the client imagine stepping into the upcoming situation with that empowered state already activated. Visualize it going well.
- *When:* For reducing anxiety and reinforcing readiness for specific events.

**3. Mental Rehearsal / Visualization**

- *How:* Guide the client through visualizing the scenario going successfully. Use all senses: what they see, hear, feel, and how they respond confidently.
- *When:* When they need confidence before high-stakes moments (e.g., negotiations, exams, difficult conversations).

**4. Inner Coach Dialogue**

- *How:* Have the client personify their “inner coach” or wise self. What advice or encouragement would this part give them before the situation?
- *When:* To shift from self-doubt to inner empowerment and self-support.

**5. State Mapping (Circle of Excellence)**

- *How:* Map out the state the client wants to feel (confidence, calm, etc.). Use a physical circle or mental image. Have them “step into” the circle while activating empowering memories.
- *When:* When the client wants a repeatable ritual for entering a desired state.

**6. Breathwork and Physiology Shift**

- *How:* Teach body-based techniques like power posing, box breathing, or movement rituals to shift state instantly.
- *When:* Just before entering the triggering situation or as a morning ritual.

**7. Belief Reframe**

- *How:* Challenge limiting beliefs behind the situation. Ask: “What would you believe if you knew you could handle this?” or “What’s the cost of not believing in yourself here?”
- *When:* When fear or doubt undermines confidence.

**8. Micro-Wins Reflection**

- *How:* Ask the client to recall small wins where they handled similar situations well. Document them as proof of capability.
- *When:* When the client says “I’ve never done this before” or feels underqualified.

**9. Role Modeling**

- *How:* Have the client think of someone they admire who handles similar situations well. Ask: “What would they do here?” or “How would they think or act?”
- *When:* To model excellence and build behavioral strategies.

**10. Music or Mood Cues**

- *How:* Invite the client to create a playlist or sensory trigger (e.g., scent, item, quote) that puts them into their ideal emotional state.
- *When:* Pre-performance ritual or confidence booster.
