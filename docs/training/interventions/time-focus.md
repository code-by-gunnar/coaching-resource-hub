### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Timeline Visualization (NLP)**

- *How:* Ask client to imagine their personal timeline — where is the past, present, and future located visually? Guide them to “float” above their timeline, revisit a past event or look ahead to the future. Reframe or gain insight.
- *When:* When client is stuck in a loop about past or future events.

**2. Re-imprinting (NLP Advanced)**

- *How:* Support client in revisiting a painful past memory as their adult self. Invite healing by bringing in support, wisdom, or a new perspective.
- *When:* For inner child work or trauma that’s shaping their present.

**3. Parts Integration (NLP)**

- *How:* If client feels inner conflict (e.g., one part wants change, another resists), guide dialogue between parts. Use visualization or hands to represent parts.
- *When:* When a client is split between past safety and future possibility.

**4. Future Pacing**

- *How:* After identifying a new belief or plan, walk the client into the future imagining success. Anchor confidence and belief in ability.
- *When:* When fear about the future is holding them back.

**5. Cognitive Reframing**

- *How:* Gently challenge beliefs formed from past events. Ask: “What else could that mean?” “What did you learn that made you stronger?”
- *When:* When client is defining themselves by past pain or failure.

**6. Gratitude Timeline**

- *How:* Create a timeline of significant past events — ask what they’re grateful for or learned from each.
- *When:* When they need to reframe the narrative of their life.

**7. Somatic Awareness**

- *How:* Ask where the memory or worry shows up in their body. Guide breath or movement to bring release.
- *When:* When the client feels stuck emotionally or physically.

**8. Empty Chair (Gestalt-style)**

- *How:* Let them speak to their past or future self in the empty chair. Invite compassion, forgiveness, advice, or reassurance.
- *When:* When closure or encouragement is needed.

**9. Values Check-In**

- *How:* Explore whether current anxiety is misaligned with core values. Reconnect them to purpose.
- *When:* When they feel lost, drifting, or afraid to move forward.

**10. Visualization: Future Self**

- *How:* Guide the client to meet their future self who has already overcome the challenge. Ask: “What would they want to tell you now?”
- *When:* To increase motivation, reduce fear, and access wisdom.
