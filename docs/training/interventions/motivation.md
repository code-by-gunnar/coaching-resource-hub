### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

- *When:* When the client needs clarity, direction, and accountability.

**2. SMART Goals Framework**

- *How:* Ensure goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
- *When:* When goals are vague or overwhelming. Helps make them actionable and trackable.

**3. Motivation Mapping**

- *How:* Explore both intrinsic (values, joy, purpose) and extrinsic (rewards, recognition) motivators. Ask: “Why do you want this?”
- *When:* When energy is low and the goal feels disconnected from meaning.

**4. Values-Driven Goals**

- *How:* Align goals with the client’s core values. Ask: “What value is this goal honoring?”
- *When:* When the client procrastinates due to lack of connection or relevance.

**5. Visualization of Success**

- *When:* To create emotional buy-in and increase confidence.

**6. Energy Audit**

- *How:* Help the client assess what tasks drain them vs. energize them. Refocus goals based on energizing activities.

**7. Micro-Steps Planning**

- *When:* When the client is overwhelmed or avoiding the task.

**8. Time Travel Technique**

- *How:* Ask: “What would your future self want you to do today?” or “How will you feel a month from now if you don’t start?”
- *When:* When motivation is blocked by short-term comfort.

**9. Identity-Based Goals**

- *How:* Link goals to a desired identity: “Who do you want to become?” and “What would that person do today?”
- *When:* When the client is unsure about external goals but motivated by inner growth.

**10. Accountability Planning**
