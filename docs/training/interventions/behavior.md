# Unwanted behaviour

### 🔎 Client Situation: Engaging in Unwanted Behaviour

*Client continues patterns or habits they want to change (e.g., emotional reactivity, scrolling, unhealthy eating, avoidance, self-sabotage). They may feel stuck, frustrated, or ashamed.*

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Habit Loop Analysis (Cue–Routine–Reward)**

- *How:* Break down the behaviour: What triggers it? What’s the routine? What’s the reward? Explore how to interrupt or replace the loop.
- *When:* To increase awareness and create strategic alternatives.

**2. Pattern Interruption**

- *How:* Identify the moment right before the behaviour starts. Introduce a new, small action to disrupt the usual flow.
- *When:* When the behaviour is automatic or unconscious.

**3. Parts Work (Conflicting Intentions)**

- *How:* Dialogue with the part of the client that engages in the behaviour. Ask: “What are you trying to protect or give me?”
- *When:* When there’s inner conflict or self-sabotage.

**4. Environmental Design**

- *How:* Help the client modify their environment to reduce friction for positive choices and increase friction for unwanted ones.
- *When:* When behaviour is triggered by cues in their space or routine.

**5. Identity Shift Work**

- *How:* Ask: “What kind of person do you want to be?” and link behaviour change to identity: “What would that version of you choose?”
- *When:* To shift from “trying to change” to “becoming someone new.”

**6. Anchoring a Desired State**

- *How:* Help the client access a powerful state (calm, focused, empowered) and anchor it to replace the emotional need behind the behaviour.
- *When:* When behaviour is emotion-driven.

**7. Values-Based Reframing**

- *How:* Identify which values the client wants to honour and how the new behaviour aligns with that. Ask: “How does this shift reflect who you want to be?”
- *When:* When they need a deeper reason to commit to change.

**8. Implementation Intentions**

- *How:* Create if–then plans. Example: “If I feel triggered, then I will [take a breath, go for a walk, text my coach].”
- *When:* To move from awareness to action.

**9. Self-Compassion Practice**

- *How:* Encourage the client to meet slip-ups with kindness. Use journaling, affirmations, or inner dialogue.
- *When:* When shame or guilt is creating resistance to change.

**10. Accountability & Habit Tracking**

- *How:* Set up simple tracking (checklists, journals, app). Include regular reviews. Celebrate small wins.
- *When:* To build consistency and self-trust.

### 🔎 Powerful Coaching Questions

- “What need is this behaviour trying to meet?”
- “What does this part of you believe it’s protecting you from?”
- “What would success look like if it felt compassionate, not forceful?”
- “What’s the smallest change you can make that would move you toward who you want to be?”
- “If you forgave yourself for this behaviour, what would become possible?”

**Tip:** Unwanted behaviours are often outdated solutions. Help clients get curious, not critical — and build lasting change through identity, environment, and compassion.
