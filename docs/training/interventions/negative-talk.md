# Stuck in negative self-talk

### 🔎 Client Situation: Stuck in Negative Self-Talk

*The client is trapped in a cycle of self-criticism, doubt, and harsh inner dialogue. This may affect their confidence, decision-making, and ability to take action.*

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Inner Critic Dialogue**

- *How:* Help the client identify and personify their inner critic. Give it a name or voice. Then introduce the Inner Coach or Wise Self to respond.
- *When:* To create awareness and separation from the self-critical voice.

**2. Cognitive Reframing**

- *How:* Challenge negative thoughts with evidence-based questions. Ask: “What’s another way to view this?” or “What would a friend say about this?”
- *When:* When beliefs are distorted or absolute (e.g., “I always fail.”)

**3. Self-Talk Audit**

- *How:* Have the client track their inner dialogue for 1–2 days and bring examples. Review and reframe together.
- *When:* When they’re unaware of how frequently or intensely they engage in negative talk.

**4. Strengths Reconnection**

- *How:* Identify their key strengths and recall past successes. Use these to counter limiting beliefs with real examples.
- *When:* To shift focus from what’s wrong to what’s already working.

**5. Affirmation Rewrite**

- *How:* Rewrite negative statements into empowering affirmations. Ground them in truth, not toxic positivity.
- *When:* To create new internal language over time.

**6. Parts Work (Critic vs. Protector)**

- *How:* Explore what the inner critic is trying to protect. Ask: “What is this voice trying to prevent or avoid?”
- *When:* When the negative talk has a root in fear, shame, or perfectionism.

**7. Pattern Origin Exploration**

- *How:* Explore where the voice may have originated — a parent, teacher, or past version of self. Bring compassion to that origin.
- *When:* For deeper self-awareness and emotional healing.

**8. Visualization Shift**

- *How:* Visualize turning the volume down on the inner critic, changing its tone, or replacing it with a positive image.
- *When:* To make the inner voice less intimidating or dominant.

**9. Future Self Message**

- *How:* Have the client imagine receiving a message from their confident, future self. Ask: “What would they want you to know right now?”
- *When:* When the client needs encouragement or hope.

**10. Metaphor Work**

- *How:* Turn the inner critic into a character, creature, or symbol. Explore how they can befriend, set boundaries with, or transform it.
- *When:* When the client enjoys creative or visual processing.

- “How would your future self speak to you right now?”
- “What new story would you like to tell yourself instead?”
