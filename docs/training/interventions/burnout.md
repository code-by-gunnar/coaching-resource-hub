# Low energy and burnout

### 🔎 Client Situation: Low Energy, Burnout, or Exhaustion

Clients may show signs of fatigue, lack of motivation, emotional flatness, or physical exhaustion. Often tied to stress, misaligned values, over-commitment, or emotional overload.

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Energy Audit**

- *How:* Help the client list what drains vs. what energizes them (people, tasks, habits).
- *When:* To gain clarity on energy leaks and potential restorers.

**2. Wheel of Life (Burnout-Focused)**

- *How:* Use the Wheel of Life, but reframe it around energy and fulfillment in each area.
- *When:* To spot where imbalance or burnout is strongest.

**3. Micro-Restoration Planning**

- *How:* Create small daily or weekly actions that restore energy (e.g., 5-min nature walk, journaling, breathwork).
- *When:* When client says they have “no time” or “nothing helps.”

**4. Values Alignment Check**

- *How:* Explore whether their life/work is aligned with their core values. Misalignment often causes burnout.
- *When:* When energy dips are chronic or existential.

**5. Compassionate Prioritization**

- *How:* Guide client to rank responsibilities based on importance vs. urgency. Invite them to let go or delegate.
- *When:* When they're overwhelmed and stretched too thin.

**6. “Permission to Pause” Exercise**

- *How:* Ask: “If you gave yourself full permission to rest, what would change?”
- *When:* When guilt or perfectionism blocks rest.

**7. Somatic Check-In**

- *How:* Invite awareness to body tension, posture, fatigue. Let the body “speak.”
- *When:* When client is disconnected from physical signals.

**8. Resilience Inventory**

- *How:* Reflect on past times they felt energized or overcame stress. What worked? What supported them?
- *When:* To reconnect them with internal and external resources.

**9. Nervous System Regulation**

- *How:* Teach breathing, tapping, or grounding exercises to help them move out of fight/flight/freeze.
- *When:* When client is frazzled or shut down.

**10. Purpose Reconnection**

- *How:* Ask: “What would make this effort feel meaningful again?” or “What are you doing this *for*?”
- *When:* When burnout is linked to a loss of motivation or deeper ‘why.’

### 🔎 Powerful Questions

- "What’s draining your energy that you’ve been tolerating?"
- "What would your body say it needs right now?"
- "If you could take one small action today for yourself, what would it be?"
- "What boundary or ‘no’ would feel like relief to say?"
- "When did you last feel truly restored? What was happening then?"

**Tip:** With burnout, slow down the coaching pace. Start with nervous system and energy awareness before diving into problem-solving or goal-setting.
