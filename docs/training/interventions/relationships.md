### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Perspective Shifting**

- *How:* Invite the client to explore the other person’s point of view. Ask: “If you were them, how might you see this?” or use role-reversal exercises.
- *When:* When blame or misunderstanding dominates. Encourages empathy and awareness.

**2. Nonviolent Communication (NVC)**

- *How:* Use the NVC model: **Observation → Feeling → Need → Request**. Guide the client to express emotions and needs clearly without judgment.
- *When:* When communication is emotionally charged or conflict-based.

**3. Values Clarification**

- *How:* Help the client identify which personal values are being honored or violated. Ask: “What value of yours is at stake here?”
- *When:* When there’s confusion, emotional triggers, or conflicting expectations.

**4. The Drama Triangle (Karpman)**

- *How:* Identify roles: Victim, Rescuer, Persecutor. Shift client toward Empowerment Triangle roles: Creator, Coach, Challenger.
- *When:* When conflict repeats or roles feel stuck.

**5. Boundary Coaching**

- *How:* Help the client define emotional, time, or communication boundaries. Practice how they might assert them respectfully.
- *When:* When they feel resentful, overwhelmed, or taken for granted.

**6. Parts Work or Chair Work**

- *How:* Let the client speak from the parts of them that feel conflicted (e.g., the part that wants connection vs. the part that wants space).
- *When:* When torn between emotions or unsure about a decision.

**7. Reframing the Story**

- *How:* Explore a new interpretation of what happened. Ask: “Is there another way to view this situation?”
- *When:* When stuck in one narrative that creates anger or hurt.

**8. Emotional Validation & Naming**

- *How:* Help the client name their feelings and give permission for them to exist. Normalize and validate what they feel.
- *When:* When emotions are high or hard to articulate.

**9. Forgiveness Process (If Appropriate)**

- *How:* Explore what forgiveness would look like for *them*, not the other person. Focus on emotional release.
- *When:* When holding onto resentment blocks healing or clarity.

**10. Future Visioning for the Relationship**

- *How:* Ask: “What kind of relationship do you want to create?” Work backward from that vision.
- *When:* When they feel stuck in the past or unsure how to move forward.

### 🔎 Powerful Coaching Questions

- “What do you want to feel in this relationship that you don’t feel now?”
- “What value of yours is being challenged here?”
- “What does the other person need that they may not be expressing well?”
- “What boundary would help protect your peace?”
- “If this relationship were a mirror, what is it showing you about yourself?”

**Tip:** Hold space without judgment. Relationships are often layered with history and vulnerability. Your role is to provide clarity, tools, and a non-judgmental space for reflection.
