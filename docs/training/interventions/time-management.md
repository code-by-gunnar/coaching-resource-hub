# Struggling with time management

### 🔎 Client Situation: Struggling with Time Management

*Client feels overwhelmed, can’t prioritize, procrastinates, or often runs out of time. May express guilt, burnout, or a sense of constant busyness without progress.*

### ⚡ Techniques & How to Use Them

**1. Time Audit Exercise**

- *How:* Ask the client to track their time for a day or week in 30–60 min blocks. Review how time is actually being spent vs. how they want to spend it.
- *When:* To bring awareness and uncover time leaks.

**2. Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent vs. Important)**

- *How:* Plot tasks into 4 quadrants: Urgent/Important, Not Urgent/Important, Urgent/Not Important, Not Urgent/Not Important.
- *When:* To prioritize and eliminate distractions.

**3. The One Thing / MIT (Most Important Task)**

- *How:* Ask: “What’s the one thing you can do today that will make everything else easier or unnecessary?” Focus daily on the MIT.
- *When:* When client is overwhelmed by to-do lists or scattered focus.

**4. Time Blocking & Theme Days**

- *How:* Assign chunks of time to specific types of work or themes. Example: Monday = Admin, Tuesday = Client Work.
- *When:* To create focus, rhythm, and intentional structure.

**5. Energy-Based Planning**

- *How:* Identify high- and low-energy times of day. Schedule creative or focus-heavy work during peak times.
- *When:* When client is frustrated by lack of productivity despite effort.

**6. Boundary Coaching**

- *How:* Help the client say no, delegate, or protect time. Ask: “What would respecting your time look like this week?”
- *When:* When over-committing or constant interruptions are the issue.

**7. Parkinson’s Law Reset**

- *How:* Use the principle that “work expands to fill the time available.” Give shorter deadlines or constraints to boost urgency and focus.
- *When:* When tasks drag on unnecessarily.

**8. Anti-Perfectionism Planning**

- *How:* Ask: “What does ‘good enough’ look like?” or “How would you do this if it didn’t need to be perfect?”
- *When:* When perfectionism causes delay or avoidance.

**9. Habit Stacking & Ritual Design**

- *How:* Build new habits by attaching them to existing ones. Design morning or evening routines for consistent progress.
- *When:* For sustainable time management habits.

**10. Accountability & Reflection**

- *How:* Set weekly check-ins, journal prompts, or action reviews. Celebrate what’s working and adjust what’s not.
- *When:* To support behavior change and maintain momentum.
