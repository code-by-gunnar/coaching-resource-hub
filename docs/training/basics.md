## Common Beginner Challenges

### Challenge 1: Asking Too Many Questions
**Problem:** Rapid-fire questioning without allowing processing time
**Solution:** Ask one question, then wait. Count to 10 if needed.

### Challenge 2: Giving Advice
**Problem:** Jumping in with solutions instead of helping client find their own
**Solution:** Catch yourself and ask, "What do you think would work?"

### Challenge 3: Taking Responsibility for Client Results
**Problem:** Feeling responsible when clients don't take action
**Solution:** Remember that clients are responsible for their own outcomes

### Challenge 4: Talking Too Much
**Problem:** Coach talking more than 20% of the time
**Solution:** Practice the 80/20 rule - client talks 80%, coach talks 20%

### Challenge 5: Losing Focus
**Problem:** Conversations that wander without clear direction
**Solution:** Regularly check in: "How is this conversation serving you?"
