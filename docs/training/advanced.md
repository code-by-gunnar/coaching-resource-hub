### 🎯 Anchoring for Peak Performance

Create powerful resource states clients can access instantly:

#### **Kinesthetic Anchoring**
Physical gestures that trigger confident states:

**The Process:**
1. **Identify the desired state** - "Think of a time when you felt completely confident"
2. **Amplify the experience** - "Make that memory bigger, brighter, more vivid"
3. **Physical anchor** - Gentle touch on hand or shoulder at peak intensity
4. **Break state** - Distract client completely
5. **Test anchor** - Apply same touch and observe state change
6. **Future pace** - "When will you use this confidence anchor?"

**Applications:**
- Pre-presentation confidence
- Interview preparation
- Difficult conversation courage
- Performance anxiety management

#### **Submodality Work**
Changing how memories and experiences are internally represented:

**Visual Submodalities:**
- Brightness, size, color/black & white
- Location, distance, movement
- Focus, framing, perspective

**Auditory Submodalities:**
- Volume, tone, tempo
- Location, direction, clarity
- Internal/external voices

**Kinesthetic Submodalities:**
- Temperature, pressure, texture
- Size, weight, movement
- Location, intensity

**Exercise: Confidence vs. Doubt**
> Have client think of something they're confident about, then something they doubt. Notice differences in how these are represented internally. Transfer confident submodalities to the doubtful situation.

### ⏰ Timeline Techniques

Help clients reframe their relationship with past, present, and future:

#### **Timeline Healing**
Resolving limiting decisions from the past:

**The Process:**
1. **Float above timeline** - "Imagine floating above the line of your life"
2. **Locate the event** - "Where on your timeline is that difficult experience?"
3. **Go before the event** - "Float to just before this happened"
4. **Adult wisdom** - "What does your current wise self want to tell your younger self?"
5. **Healing and resources** - Provide what was needed then
6. **Integration** - "Notice how this changes your entire timeline"

#### **Future Creation**
Building compelling, motivating futures:

**Steps:**
1. **Desired outcome** - "What do you want to achieve?"
2. **Timeline positioning** - "Place this goal on your timeline"
3. **Step into future** - "Step into having achieved this goal"
4. **Amplify experience** - Make it vivid and compelling
5. **Trace back path** - "What steps led to this success?"
6. **Anchor motivation** - Create physical anchor for this future state

### 🔍 Meta-Model Mastery

Advanced questioning to challenge limiting language patterns:

#### **Deletions**
Information that's been left out:

**Client:** "I can't do this."
**Coach:** "What specifically can't you do?" (Simple deletion)

**Client:** "People don't understand me."
**Coach:** "Which people specifically?" (Unspecified noun)

**Client:** "I'm confused."
**Coach:** "Confused about what specifically?" (Unspecified verb)

#### **Distortions**
When cause and effect are confused:

**Client:** "My boss makes me angry."
**Coach:** "How specifically does your boss make you angry?" (Cause-effect)

**Client:** "I know she doesn't like me."
**Coach:** "How do you know she doesn't like you?" (Mind reading)

**Client:** "If I speak up, everyone will think I'm stupid."
**Coach:** "How does speaking up mean people will think you're stupid?" (Complex equivalence)

#### **Generalizations**
When specific experiences become universal rules:

**Client:** "I always mess up presentations."
**Coach:** "Always? Has there never been a time when a presentation went well?" (Universal quantifier)

**Client:** "I can't ask for help."
**Coach:** "What would happen if you did ask for help?" (Modal operator)

**Client:** "All managers are difficult."
**Coach:** "All managers? Every single one?" (Universal quantifier)

## Solution-Focused Coaching 🎯

*Focus on solutions rather than problems to create rapid, positive change.*

### The Miracle Question
One of the most powerful coaching interventions:

**"Suppose tonight while you sleep, a miracle happens and the problem that brought you to coaching is completely solved. You don't know the miracle happened because you were sleeping. When you wake up tomorrow, what would be the first thing you'd notice that would tell you the miracle had occurred?"**

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "What else would be different?"
- "How would others know the miracle happened?"
- "What would your [spouse/boss/children] notice?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, where would you be then?"

---

### 📊 Scaling Questions

Powerful tools for measuring progress and creating hope:

#### **Progress Scaling**
- "On a scale of 1-10, where 10 is your goal achieved and 1 is the worst it's been, where are you today?"
- "What tells you you're at a 5 and not a 4?"
- "What would need to happen to move from 5 to 6?"
- "When have you been at a 7 before? What was different then?"

#### **Confidence Scaling**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that you can achieve this goal?"
- "What would need to happen to increase your confidence by one point?"
- "What's your confidence that if you were at point X on progress, you'd notice?"

#### **Motivation Scaling**
- "How motivated are you to work on this goal? (1-10)"
- "What would increase your motivation?"
- "When has your motivation been higher? What was different then?"

---

### 🔍 Exception Finding

Discover times when the problem wasn't present:

**"Tell me about a time recently when this problem wasn't happening, or wasn't as bad."**

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "What was different about that time?"
- "How did you make that happen?"
- "Who else was involved?"
- "What would need to happen for more of that?"
- "What did others notice about you then?"

**Creating More Exceptions:**
- "What would it take to have that happen again?"
- "What's the smallest step toward creating more of that?"
- "How will you know you're making progress?"

### 🔧 Powerful Interventions

#### **Empty Chair Technique**

5. Continue dialogue until integration emerges
6. Find the underlying need both sides share

#### **Parts Integration**
When client has internal conflicts:

**"Part of me wants X, but part of me wants Y"**

1. **Identify the parts** - "What does the part that wants X really want?"
2. **Understand positive intentions** - Both parts want something good
3. **Find common ground** - What do both parts ultimately want?
4. **Create integration** - How can both needs be met?
5. **Check ecology** - Does this feel right to all parts?

#### **Perspective Shifting**
Help clients see situations from multiple viewpoints:

**Positions:**
- **First Position** - Your own perspective and experience
