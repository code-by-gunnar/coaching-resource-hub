# Techniques and how to use them

Applying **Gestalt principles** to coaching, especially in **life coaching**, can help clients develop self-awareness, take responsibility for their actions, and make meaningful changes. Here’s how you can integrate Gestalt techniques into your coaching sessions:

---

### **1. The Here and Now Focus**

**Application in Coaching:**

- Encourage clients to stay present rather than dwell on the past or worry about the future.
- Ask **"What are you feeling right now?"** instead of focusing on long-winded stories from the past.

**Example:**

A client struggles with procrastination. Instead of analysing why, you ask:

💬 *“What do you notice in your body when you think about taking action right now?”*

This shifts their attention to the present moment and emotional response.

---

### **2. The Empty Chair Technique**

**Application in Coaching:**

- Used for self-dialogue, decision-making, or addressing unresolved issues.
- Helps clients confront fears, inner critics, or people they have unresolved conflict with.

**Example:**

A client is torn between leaving or staying in a stressful job.

🎭 You ask them to imagine **one version of themselves in one chair (quitting)** and the **other version in another chair (staying)** and have a conversation.

This helps them explore emotions and come to a decision.

---

### **3. Staying with the Feeling**

**Application in Coaching:**

- Encourages clients to fully experience emotions instead of avoiding them.
- Helps uncover deeper motivations or blocks.

**Example:**

A client expresses frustration about lack of motivation.

Instead of problem-solving immediately, you ask:

🧠 *“Can you sit with that frustration for a moment? What comes up for you?”*

This can lead to deeper insights, such as fear of failure or perfectionism.

---

### **4. Body Awareness**

**Application in Coaching:**

- Helps clients notice how emotions manifest physically.
- Connects mind and body for deeper self-awareness.

**Example:**

A client dealing with social anxiety describes a tight chest before social interactions.

You guide them to notice and describe the sensation:

⚡ *“Where do you feel that tension? What happens when you focus on it?”*

This helps them become aware of bodily reactions and manage stress.

---

### **5. Exaggeration Technique**

**Application in Coaching:**

- Helps bring unconscious behaviours to awareness.
- Encourages clients to notice patterns in speech, gestures, or habits.

**Example:**

A client shrugs every time they say, *"I guess I could try."*

You ask them to **exaggerate the shrug** and say it louder.

👀 This reveals **hesitation and self-doubt**, leading to a discussion about confidence.

---

### **6. Reversals**

**Application in Coaching:**

- Helps clients explore suppressed emotions or untapped strengths.
- Encourages thinking from a different perspective.

**Example:**

A client says they always have to be the **“strong provider”** and can’t be vulnerable.

You ask them:

🔄 *“What if you embraced the opposite? What would it be like to show vulnerability?”*

This opens up a new perspective on emotional well-being.

---

### **7. Dream Work & Metaphors**

**Application in Coaching:**

- Instead of interpreting dreams, you ask clients to step into symbols or metaphors.
- Helps reveal subconscious feelings.

**Example:**

A client describes feeling **"like they’re drowning"** in work.

Instead of analysing, you ask:

🌊 *“If you were actually in water, what would you do?”*

They might say: *“I’d look for something to hold onto.”*

This leads to a realization about seeking support or setting boundaries.
