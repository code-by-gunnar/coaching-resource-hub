# Building the Coaching Connection Script (Example)

*(A structured guide to establish trust, rapport, and a strong foundation for coaching.)*

---

### **1. Opening the Session – Creating a Comfortable Space**

**Coach:**

*"Welcome! I’m really excited to start this coaching journey with you. My role as a coach is to help you explore your goals, challenges, and opportunities, and to support you in finding the best path forward. This is a space where you can be completely open, and everything we discuss remains confidential."*

*(Pause for acknowledgement.)*

*"Before we dive in, let’s take a moment to get comfortable. How are you feeling about today’s session?"*

*(Encourage the client to share. If they seem nervous, reassure them.)*

---

### **2. Establishing Rapport & Trust**

**Coach:**

*"To make the most of our time together, I want to ensure that we have a strong coaching connection. That means our conversations are built on **trust, honesty, and openness**. My goal is to create a space where you feel completely supported. Does that sound good to you?"*

*(Pause for confirmation.)*

*"To help build our connection, I’ll be actively listening, asking you powerful questions, and sometimes reflecting back what I hear to make sure I truly understand your perspective. If at any point something doesn’t feel right, or you need to pause, just let me know. This is your journey."*

---

### **3. Clarifying the Coaching Relationship**

**Coach:**

*"Let’s take a moment to talk about what coaching is and what it isn’t. Coaching is about helping you discover your own answers rather than giving advice or telling you what to do. You are the expert in your own life, and my role is to guide you through deeper thinking, reflection, and action."*

🔹 **Key Coaching Principles:**

- *I’m here to support you, but the responsibility for change lies with you.*
- *This is a safe, judgment-free space.*
- *Everything we discuss is confidential.*

*"Does this approach align with what you’re looking for in coaching?"*

*(Pause for agreement and address any questions.)*

---

### **4. Setting Boundaries & Expectations**

**Coach:**

*"To ensure we work effectively together, let’s establish some boundaries and expectations."*

🔹 **Key Areas to Cover:**

✔ **Session Structure:** *“We will meet for [duration] every [frequency].”*

✔ **Confidentiality:** *“Everything is private unless there is a legal or ethical reason to disclose.”*

✔ **Client Responsibility:** *“You drive the conversation, and I help facilitate your insights.”*

✔ **Coach Availability:** *“Outside sessions, I’m available via [email, message, etc.] for brief check-ins if needed.”*

*"Does this structure work for you? Is there anything else you’d like to clarify?"*

---

### **5. Building Trust Through Active Listening & Powerful Questions**

🔹 **Active Listening Techniques Used by the Coach:**

✔ **Paraphrasing:** *“So what I’m hearing is…”*

✔ **Clarifying:** *“Can you tell me more about that?”*

✔ **Observing Non-Verbal Cues:** *Paying attention to tone, pauses, and body language.*

**Coach:**

*"To get started, I’d love to understand more about what brought you here today. What is the most important thing you’d like to focus on in our coaching sessions?"*

*(Pause and listen actively.)*

🔹 **Follow-Up Questions to Deepen the Conversation:**

- *“What does success look like for you in this area?”*
- *“What challenges are you currently facing?”*
- *“If there were no limits, what would you want to achieve?”*

*(Encourage exploration and ensure the client feels heard.)*

---

### **6. Closing the Session – Strengthening the Connection**

**Coach:**

*"I really appreciate your openness today. Before we wrap up, what are your thoughts on how today’s conversation went?"*

*(Pause for reflection.)*

*"Moving forward, what can I do to make sure you feel fully supported in our coaching journey?"*

*(Pause for feedback.)*

*"I look forward to working together and helping you achieve your goals. Our next session will be on [date], and in the meantime, feel free to reflect on today’s discussion. Thank you for your time!"*
