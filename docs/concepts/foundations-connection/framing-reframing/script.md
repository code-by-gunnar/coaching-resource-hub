# Coaching Script: Framing & Reframing

*(A step-by-step guide to help clients shift their perspective and reframe challenges into opportunities.)*

---

## **1. Opening the Session – Identifying the Client’s Challenge**

**Coach:**

*"Welcome! Today, we’re going to explore how we can shift perspectives on challenges you may be facing. This technique, called **reframing**, helps us see things in a more empowering way. Are you open to trying this?"*

*(Wait for confirmation.)*

*"Great! Let’s start by identifying a situation, belief, or challenge that’s been on your mind. What’s something you’ve been struggling with lately?"*

*(Allow the client to describe their issue.)*

📌 **Example Response from Client:**

*"I failed an important job interview, and now I feel like I’ll never get hired."*

---

## **2. Step 1: Understanding the Current Frame**

**Coach:**

*"I hear you. Let’s take a closer look at this. What does this situation mean to you right now?"*

*(Encourage the client to express their thoughts and emotions.)*

🔹 **Follow-Up Questions:**

- *“What story are you telling yourself about this situation?”*
- *“What assumptions are you making?”*
- *“How is this belief affecting your confidence and actions?”*

📌 **Client Response:**

*"It means I’m not good enough and companies don’t want to hire me."*

🔹 **Coach Response:**

*"That’s a tough feeling. But what if we looked at this differently? Let’s explore some new perspectives."*

---

## **3. Step 2: Applying Different Types of Reframing**

### **🔹 Option 1: Context Reframing** *(Changing the situation where something is useful.)*

**Coach:**

*"Is there any way this experience might be **useful** to you?"*

📌 **Client Response:**

*"Maybe… I did learn what types of questions they ask."*

**Coach:**

*"That’s a great insight! What if this wasn’t a failure, but just **practice** for the right opportunity?"*

📌 **New Frame:**

*"This interview was a stepping stone. I’m better prepared for my next one."*

---

### **🔹 Option 2: Meaning Reframing** *(Changing the meaning of the event.)*

**Coach:**

*"Let’s say two people fail an interview. One thinks, ‘I’ll never get hired,’ while the other thinks, ‘Now I know what to improve for next time.’ Which mindset will lead to better results?"*

📌 **Client Response:**

*"The second one, obviously."*

**Coach:**

*"So, what if this experience isn’t proof that you’re not good enough, but rather an **opportunity to grow**?"*

📌 **New Frame:**

*"This wasn’t a failure—it was feedback that will help me succeed."*

---

### **🔹 Option 3: Perspective Reframing** *(Seeing the situation from another person’s viewpoint.)*

**Coach:**

*"Imagine you’re the hiring manager. What do you think they saw in you?"*

📌 **Client Response:**

*"Well, they did say I had good experience, but I lacked confidence in my answers."*

**Coach:**

*"That’s really valuable information! What if their feedback was actually meant to **help you improve**?"*

📌 **New Frame:**

*"The interviewer’s feedback wasn’t rejection—it was a **signal** for what I need to work on."*

---

## **4. Step 3: Integrating the New Frame**

**Coach:**

*"Now that we’ve looked at this from different perspectives, how does this situation feel to you now?"*

*(Encourage the client to reflect on their shift in thinking.)*

🔹 **Follow-Up Questions:**

- *“What’s the biggest insight you’ve gained from this?”*
- *“How can you use this new perspective moving forward?”*
- *“What action will you take next with this new mindset?”*

📌 **Client Response:**

*"I realize that this interview wasn’t a failure—it was a lesson. I’m going to practice my answers and go into my next interview more prepared."*

---

## **5. Closing the Session – Strengthening the Reframe**

**Coach:**

*"I love the shift you’ve made today! You’ve transformed this from a failure into a growth opportunity. To reinforce this, how can you remind yourself of this new perspective when doubts creep in?"*

*(Help the client create a mental anchor, journal prompt, or affirmation.)*

*"I’m excited to hear how your next interview goes! Would you like to check in on this in our next session?"*

*(Wrap up with encouragement and accountability.)*

### **Final Notes on Using This Script**

✔ Use **Context Reframing** when a client sees a trait as a weakness.

✔ Use **Meaning Reframing** when a client attaches a negative meaning to an event.

✔ Use **Perspective Reframing** when a client feels stuck in a one-sided view.

✔ Adapt the script to different **personal and professional coaching situations**.
