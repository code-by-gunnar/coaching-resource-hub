# Solution Focused Coaching

**Solution-Focused Coaching** is a **goal-oriented, future-focused coaching approach** that helps clients identify and implement solutions rather than dwelling on problems. Instead of analyzing why a problem exists, it shifts the client’s mindset toward **what works, what’s possible, and what actions will lead to success**.

✔ **Accelerates progress** – Moves clients toward actionable steps quickly.

✔ **Builds confidence** – Helps clients recognize past successes and apply them to new challenges.

## **Key Principles of Solution-Focused Coaching**

### **1. Focus on Solutions, Not Problems**

🔹 Traditional coaching often explores **why** a problem exists.

🔹 Solution-focused coaching asks, *“What’s one thing you can do to improve this situation?”*

📌 **Example:** Instead of saying, *"Why do I keep procrastinating?"*, a solution-focused approach asks, *"What’s one small step you can take right now?"*

---

### **2. Identifying Strengths & Past Successes**

🔹 Clients often have **hidden strengths** or past experiences that can help them now.

🔹 The coach helps uncover **what has worked before** and how to apply it to the current goal.

📌 **Example:** *"Can you think of a time when you successfully overcame a similar challenge? What did you do?"*

---

### **3. Creating a Clear Vision of Success**

🔹 The coach helps the client define **what success looks like** in clear, concrete terms.

🔹 Questions like **“What will be different when you achieve this?”** help build motivation.

📌 **Example:** A client wants to improve their leadership skills. The coach asks, *"What would being a great leader look like to you?"*

---

### **4. Scaling Questions to Measure Progress**

🔹 Scaling questions help clients assess their **current position** and **what’s needed to move forward**.

📌 **Example:**

*"On a scale of 1-10, how close are you to your goal?"*

*"What would help you move one step closer?"*

---

### **5. Small, Actionable Steps**

🔹 Instead of overwhelming clients with big changes, solution-focused coaching emphasizes **small, manageable actions**.

🔹 **The key question:** *"What’s one thing you can do today to move forward?"*

📌 **Example:** A client struggling with time management sets a goal to **plan their day the night before** as a first small step.

## **When to Use Solution-Focused Coaching?**

✔ When a client feels **stuck in negative thinking** and needs a shift in focus.

✔ When a client wants **fast progress toward a specific goal**.

✔ When a client **keeps repeating the same patterns** and needs a breakthrough.

✔ When a client needs **clarity, motivation, and confidence** to take action.
