# Timeline Session Example

**A complete timeline coaching session walkthrough demonstrating how to help clients explore their past, present, and future for clarity and growth.**

Timeline Coaching is a powerful method that helps clients explore their past, present, and future to gain clarity, resolve challenges, and create a pathway to their goals. It's based on the idea that our experiences and emotions are often stored in the body, and exploring these "timelines" helps us understand how past experiences shape current behavior and future potential.

## Session Overview

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Client:** Sarah, a mid-level manager feeling stuck in her career  
**Focus:** Career clarity and overcoming limiting beliefs  
**Technique:** Timeline visualization and reframing

## Timeline Coaching Session Walkthrough

### **1. Introduction & Setting the Intention (10 minutes)**

**Coach:** "Sarah, let's start by discussing what you want to focus on today. What’s going on in your life that you’d like to explore or work through?"

**Sarah:** "I feel stuck in my current role, like I'm not progressing the way I want to. I'm not sure if it's time to leave my job or if I just need to shift my mindset."

**Coach:** "It sounds like you’re at a crossroads. Let's work through this by exploring the timeline of your career and how we can move forward. How does that sound?"

**Sarah:** "That sounds good."

### **2. Creating the Timeline (5 minutes)**

The coach helps Sarah establish her timeline by guiding her to imagine a line that represents her life journey. This can be visualized as a line stretching out from the past (on the left) to the future (on the right).

**Coach:** "I’d like you to visualize a line in front of you, stretching from the left side to the right side of the room. The left side represents your past, and the right side represents your future. We’ll place significant moments along this timeline, especially around your career. Start by placing your childhood and early career experiences, then move toward more recent times."

**Sarah:** "Okay, I can see the timeline. At the far left, I place my childhood and early school experiences. I had a lot of encouragement from my parents. Then, as I moved into my twenties, I started my first job, which was exciting but overwhelming."

### **3. Exploring Past Events (10-15 minutes)**

The coach encourages Sarah to focus on key events in her career, whether positive or negative, and the emotional impact they had on her.

**Coach:** "Let’s look back at key moments in your career that might have shaped your feelings of being stuck. What are some of the milestones or decisions that stand out to you?"

**Sarah:** "When I got my promotion five years ago, it was a big milestone. But after a year or two, I started feeling overwhelmed and unsure about my ability to lead effectively. I’ve never really shaken that feeling of imposter syndrome since."

**Coach:** "Interesting. So this feeling of ‘not being good enough’ has been present for a while. Let’s take a moment to really feel that moment and see what emotions come up. How old were you when you got that promotion?"

**Sarah:** "I was 28, just a year after I started working in this company."

**Coach:** "Imagine that version of yourself at 28. What did she need to hear at that moment?"

### **4. Reframing and Healing the Past (10-15 minutes)**

The coach helps Sarah reframe limiting beliefs or unresolved emotions tied to past events.

**Coach:** "Let’s go back to that moment. If you could offer your 28-year-old self some words of encouragement, what would you say to her?"

**Sarah:** "I’d tell her that she’s more capable than she thinks, that she’s earned her place, and she doesn’t need to be perfect to succeed."

**Coach:** "Beautiful. Now, as you imagine telling her this, notice how you feel in your body. Does it change anything for you now in the present?"

**Sarah:** "Yes, I feel lighter. I’ve been holding onto that fear for so long, but I realize it doesn’t define me."

### **5. Moving to the Present & Future (15-20 minutes)**

**Coach:** "Now, let’s shift gears and move toward the present and the future. We’ve worked on the past, and now I want you to imagine where you want to be. Where would you like to see yourself in the next 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years?"

**Sarah:** "In the next six months, I want to feel more confident in my leadership role, and in one year, I’d like to start taking on more strategic projects. In three years, I see myself in an executive leadership position."

**Coach:** "Great. Let’s visualize that future you. What qualities and skills does she have that you currently don’t feel you possess?"

**Sarah:** "She’s calm under pressure, confident in decision-making, and has a clear vision of where she wants to go. I don’t feel that clarity right now."

**Coach:** "Let’s take a moment to really step into that future self. Imagine what she’s doing right now. What’s one small action you can take today to start moving in that direction?"

**Sarah:** "I can start by asking for a mentor in the company who can help me grow in the areas I’m lacking."

### **6. Closing the Session (5 minutes)**

The coach wraps up the session by summarizing insights and action steps.

**Coach:** "It sounds like you’ve gained some powerful insights today. You’ve reconnected with a part of yourself that feels capable, and you’ve clarified some action steps. What is your takeaway from today’s session?"

**Sarah:** "I realize that my feelings of being stuck are tied to old fears, and I can take small, actionable steps to get back on track. I also now see how important mentorship will be for my growth."

**Coach:** "I’m glad to hear that. Remember to be kind to yourself as you take these steps. We’ll check in again soon to see how you’re progressing."

**Sarah:** "Thank you, I feel much more focused and energized after today’s session."
