# Coaching with Timeline

[Timeline Session Example](./session.md)

[Timeline & Compelling Goal Example](./compelling-goal.md)

**Timeline Coaching (or Timeline Therapy™)** is an **NLP-based approach** that helps clients **reprocess past experiences, remove emotional blocks, and create a compelling future**. It is based on the idea that our **perception of time** influences our emotions, behaviors, and decision-making.

This method allows clients to:

✔ **Release negative emotions** (fear, anger, guilt, sadness) tied to past experiences.

✔ **Let go of limiting beliefs** that hold them back.

✔ **Gain clarity on their life path** by organizing their past, present, and future.

✔ **Create a powerful, future-focused mindset** for success.

## **Key Concepts of Timeline Coaching**

### **1. The Personal Timeline *(How we mentally store time.)***

- Everyone has an **internal representation of time**—some people “see” the past behind them and the future ahead, while others store time differently.
- Coaches help clients **visualize and manipulate their timeline** to create positive changes.

📌 **Example:** A client who sees past failures as “always in front of them” may shift their timeline to **store them behind**, symbolizing that they have moved forward.

---

### **2. Releasing Negative Emotions (Time-Based Healing)**

- Negative emotions (anger, fear, sadness, guilt) are often **linked to past events**.
- By revisiting the first event where an emotion was experienced, the client can **reframe it** and **release its hold**.

📌 **Example:** A client feeling constant anxiety about public speaking might discover that their fear started in childhood. By **reprocessing** that memory, they can **detach from the fear**.

---

### **3. Removing Limiting Decisions & Beliefs**

- Many limiting beliefs (**“I’m not good enough”**, **“I can’t be successful”**) are **rooted in past experiences**.
- Coaches use **timeline techniques** to trace back to the event that created the belief and **rewrite the meaning**.

📌 **Example:** A client who believes they are “not a leader” might trace it back to a childhood moment where they felt ignored. By shifting their perspective, they can **reframe their identity**.

---

### **4. Future Timeline Work (Creating a Compelling Vision)**

- The future is **not fixed**—clients can **mentally rehearse success** to make it feel real and achievable.
- Coaches guide clients to **step into their future selves** and visualize success.

📌 **Example:** A client struggling with confidence can be guided to **imagine their future self standing confidently in a meeting**, strengthening their belief that this outcome is possible.

## **When to Use Timeline Coaching?**

✔ When a client feels **stuck in the past** and needs to let go.

✔ When negative emotions **keep resurfacing** and blocking progress.

✔ When a client has **deep-seated limiting beliefs** from childhood.

✔ When a client needs **clarity and motivation for future goals**.
