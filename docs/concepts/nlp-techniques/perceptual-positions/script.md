### **Shifting Perceptual Positions Coaching Script**

*(A powerful NLP technique to help clients gain new insights by seeing a situation from different perspectives.)*

---

### **Objective:**

This exercise helps clients **shift their perspective** by experiencing a situation from three different viewpoints:

1. **First Position (Self)** – Experiencing the situation from their own perspective.
2. **Second Position (Other Person)** – Seeing the situation through the eyes of another person.
3. **Third Position (Observer)** – Viewing the situation as a neutral, outside observer.

This is particularly useful for **resolving conflicts, improving relationships, and gaining clarity on emotional situations**.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Situation**

**Coach:**

*"Let’s explore a situation where you feel stuck, conflicted, or unsure how to move forward. It could be a difficult conversation, a conflict with someone, or a challenging decision."*

*(Let the client choose a specific situation.)*

*"To make this process most effective, visualize this as clearly as possible—where are you? Who else is involved? What’s happening?"*

*(Pause while the client mentally steps into the situation.)*

---

### **Step 2: First Position – Self (Your Own Perspective)**

**Coach:**

*"I want you to fully step into this moment as if it’s happening now. Imagine looking through **your own eyes** and experiencing the situation as yourself."*

- **What are you feeling?**
- **What are you thinking?**
- **What do you believe about the situation?**
- **What do you want from this interaction?**

*(Encourage the client to describe their experience in detail.)*

*"Take a deep breath and notice everything—your emotions, thoughts, and body language. When you're ready, step out of this perspective."*

---

### **Step 3: Second Position – Other Person’s Perspective**

**Coach:**

*"Now, let’s shift perspectives. Imagine stepping **into the other person’s shoes**—becoming them for a moment."*

*"Take their posture, feel their emotions, and see the world through their eyes."*

- **What do they see, hear, and feel in this situation?**
- **What do they want?**
- **What might they be thinking or believing about you?**
- **What emotions might they be experiencing?**
- **How does the situation look from their perspective?**

*(Pause and allow the client to describe this perspective.)*

*"What insights are you gaining from seeing the situation this way?"*

*(Acknowledge their response, then guide them back to a neutral state before moving to the next position.)*

---

### **Step 4: Third Position – Neutral Observer**

**Coach:**

*"Now, imagine you are an **uninvolved observer**, watching this interaction from a distance. You are a completely neutral party, watching two people (yourself and the other person) interact."*

*"Take a step back, as if watching a movie or seeing two actors on a stage. Observe without emotion or judgment."*

- **What do you notice about both people?**
- **How do they interact?**
- **What patterns or dynamics stand out?**
- **What advice would you give to both parties from this neutral perspective?**

*(Let the client process and share their insights.)*

*"What stands out most from this outside viewpoint?"*

---

### **Step 5: Integrate the Perspectives**

**Coach:**

*"Now that you've seen the situation from all three perspectives, let’s bring these insights together."*

- **From your own perspective, what did you learn?**
- **From the other person’s perspective, what do you now understand that you didn’t before?**
- **From the observer's perspective, what advice or new action steps do you see?**

*"How does this new understanding change the way you feel about the situation?"*

---

### **Step 6: Action Plan**

**Coach:**

*"Based on these insights, what action will you take moving forward?"*

*(Help the client develop a clear and constructive plan.)*

*"How will you approach this situation differently next time?"*

*(Encourage them to apply their new perspective in real life.)*

---

### **Final Notes:**

✔ **Ideal for conflict resolution, improving communication, and gaining new insights into challenging situations.**

✔ **Encourage deep visualization for the best results.**

✔ **Use neutral, open-ended questions to guide the client to new realizations.**
