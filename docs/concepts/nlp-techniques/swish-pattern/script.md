### **Swish Pattern Coaching Script**

This **detailed Swish Pattern script** will guide you through **helping a client replace an unwanted habit, fear, or negative reaction with a positive, empowering response**.

---

### **Step 1: Establish the Unwanted Behaviour/Image**

**Coach:**

*"Think of a specific situation where you experience an unwanted reaction or behaviour. It could be nervousness before speaking, procrastination, or self-doubt. Close your eyes and see the image that comes to mind when you’re about to experience this situation."*

**(Pause to allow the client to visualize.)**

*"Describe what you see in your mind’s eye. Is it a big image? Bright or dark? Close or far away?"*

*(Encourage the client to make it as clear and vivid as possible.)*

---

### **Step 2: Create the Desired Self-Image**

**Coach:**

*"Now, imagine a version of yourself who handles this situation effortlessly. This is the confident, empowered version of you—the way you want to be. How do you look? What is your posture like? How do you feel in this version of yourself?"*

*"This image should be smaller and dimmer for now. Place it in the corner of your mind, almost like a small picture-in-picture effect."*

*(Guide the client to create a vivid representation of this empowered self.)*

---

### **Step 3: The Swish Process**

**Coach:**

*"Now, we are going to do a quick mental switch. Are you ready?"*

**(Pause and ensure the client is focused.)**

*"Take the first image—the one representing the unwanted behaviour—and make it large and bright in front of you."*

*"Now, take the positive image—the empowered version of you—and in a split second, make it BIGGER, BRIGHTER, and push it FORWARD, as if it’s zooming into place, completely replacing the negative image!"*

*"At the same time, shrink the negative image, make it dim, and push it far away into the distance until it disappears completely."*

*"SWISH!"* *(Say this with energy as the client does the switch.)*

*(Pause for 3-5 seconds.)*

*"Clear your mind. Think of something neutral, like your morning routine."* *(This breaks the state before repeating.)*

---

### **Step 4: Repeat & Reinforce**

**Coach:**

*"Let’s do that again. Make the negative image big and bright… now SWISH! Shrink it down and replace it with the strong, confident image."*

*(Repeat the process **5-10 times**, encouraging speed and automaticity.)*

---

### **Step 5: Test the Results**

**Coach:**

*"Now, think about the situation that used to trigger the unwanted response. What do you notice?"*

*(Encourage the client to notice if their reaction has changed. If any remnants of the old feeling remain, repeat the Swish process.)*

*"How do you feel now? What’s different?"*

*(If successful, the client will naturally associate the situation with the **new, positive response**.)*

---

### **Step 6: Future Application**

**Coach:**

*"Whenever you face this situation in real life, your mind will automatically trigger the confident image instead of the old reaction. You’ve just rewired your brain to respond differently!"*

*"To strengthen this, practice the Swish Pattern daily for the next few days."*

### **Final Notes**

✔ Works well for **fear of public speaking, procrastination, self-doubt, cravings, or nervous habits**.

✔ The **speed of the Swish** is key—make it FAST and automatic.

✔ If the client still feels resistance, try **adjusting the clarity, size, and brightness** of the images.
