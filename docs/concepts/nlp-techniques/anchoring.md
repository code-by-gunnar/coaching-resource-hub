# Anchoring

**Create powerful emotional triggers that clients can use to access resourceful states on demand.**

Anchoring is a foundational NLP technique that creates an association between a specific trigger (stimulus) and an emotional or mental state. When properly established, the trigger can instantly access the desired state, providing clients with a powerful tool for self-regulation and peak performance.

## What is Anchoring?

Anchoring consists of three key components:

**🎯 Stimulus**  
A specific trigger such as a word, touch, gesture, sound, or visual image

**💭 Emotional/Mental State**  
The desired feeling, thought, or memory you want to access (confidence, calm, motivation, etc.)

**🔗 Association**  
The neurological link between stimulus and state that allows instant access

## The Anchoring Process

### 1. Identify the State
Choose the specific feeling or resource state you want to anchor (e.g., confidence, calm, focus)

### 2. Choose a Unique Anchor
Pick a clear, repeatable stimulus that's:
- Easy to activate
- Unique to this state
- Discrete and appropriate for the context

### 3. Intensify the State
Use activities, memories, or visualization to heighten the desired feeling to its peak intensity

### 4. Set the Anchor
Apply the stimulus precisely when the feeling reaches its strongest point

### 5. Break State
Switch to a neutral activity to cement the anchor and clear the emotional state

### 6. Test and Repeat
Test the anchor to verify it triggers the desired state. Reinforce through repetition

## Types of Anchors
