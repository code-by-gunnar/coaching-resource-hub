would be different? What would you notice first?"

Distortions:
Client: "He makes me angry"
Coach: "How specifically does he make you angry?"

Generalizations:

Coach: "Always? Can you think of a time when you didn't mess up?"

Applications:

```

**Step 3: Analysis and Insights**
```
Coaching Questions:

```

#### **Coaching Applications:**

**Goal Setting**
```
Process:
□ Identify 1-2 lowest satisfaction areas

• Schedule annual physical exam
• Reduce evening screen time for better sleep
```

**Progress Tracking**
```
Quarterly Reassessment:

### **10. Values Assessment Framework**

**Purpose:** Identify core values that guide decision-making and life choices
**Best for:** Life transitions, decision-making coaching, and authenticity work
**Process:** Values clarification through exploration and prioritization

#### **Values Exploration Methods:**

**Method 1: Values Card Sort**
```
Materials: 100+ value cards or list
Process:
1. Sort values into three piles: Very Important, Somewhat Important, Not Important
2. From "Very Important" pile, select 10 most essential values

4. Rank top 5 in order of priority
5. Define what each value means personally

Benefits:
□ Concrete, hands-on process
□ Forces prioritization decisions
□ Visual and kinesthetic engagement
□ Clear final ranking system
```

**Method 2: Peak Experience Analysis**
```
Process:
1. Client identifies 3-5 peak experiences in their life
2. For each experience, explore what made it meaningful
3. Identify values that were being honored or expressed
4. Look for common themes across experiences
5. Clarify how these values show up in current life

Peak Experience Questions:
• "Describe a time when you felt most alive and authentic."
• "What was happening during your proudest moments?"
• "When have you felt most satisfied with your choices?"
• "What experiences have given you the deepest sense of meaning?"
```

```
Process:
1. Identify areas of life where client feels conflicted or stuck
2. Explore what values might be in tension
3. Understand how different values are competing for attention
4. Find ways to honor multiple values or make conscious choices

Tension Examples:
• Security vs. Adventure
• Family vs. Career Achievement
• Independence vs. Community
• Tradition vs. Innovation

Resolution Strategies:
□ Find creative ways to honor both values
□ Make conscious choices about when each value takes priority

4. Rate how well each option honors/supports each value (1-10)
5. Calculate total scores and consider highest-rated option
6. Check decision against gut feeling and overall life vision

Example: Job Change Decision
Option A (Current Job): Security=9, Growth=4, Family=7, Creativity=3, Service=5 = 28
Option B (New Opportunity): Security=6, Growth=9, Family=6, Creativity=8, Service=7 = 36
```

**Goal Alignment Assessment**
```
Values-Goals Alignment Check:
□ List current major goals and priorities
□ Identify which core values each goal supports
□ Notice goals that don't align with any core values
□ Consider adjusting or eliminating misaligned goals
□ Develop new goals that better support core values

Alignment Questions:

### **12. Habit Stacking Framework**

**Developed by:** BJ Fogg and popularized by James Clear
**Best for:** Building new habits and routines systematically
**Focus:** Linking new behaviors to existing habits for automatic implementation

#### **Core Principles:**

**Habit Stacking Formula**
```
"After I [EXISTING HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

Examples:
• "After I pour my morning coffee, I will write in my gratitude journal."
• "After I sit down at my desk, I will review my top 3 priorities for the day."
• "After I put on my pajamas, I will prepare my clothes for tomorrow."

Selection Criteria for Anchor Habits:
□ Already happens consistently every day
□ Occurs at roughly the same time
□ Takes place in the location where new habit will happen
□ Has clear beginning and end
```

**Start Small Principle**
```
Minimum Viable Habit:
• Start with smallest possible version of desired habit
• Focus on consistency rather than intensity
• Build identity before increasing difficulty

Examples:
Desired Habit: Exercise for 45 minutes daily
Start Small: Do 2 pushups after getting out of bed

Desired Habit: Read 30 minutes before bed
Start Small: Read 1 page after brushing teeth

Desired Habit: Meditate for 20 minutes daily
Start Small: Take 3 deep breaths after sitting down at desk

Progression Strategy:
□ Week 1-2: Establish minimum viable habit
□ Week 3-4: Increase slightly if feeling easy and automatic
□ Month 2: Continue gradual increases based on success
□ Focus on consistency percentage rather than habit size
```

#### **Habit Stacking Coaching Process:**

**Habit Design Session (45 minutes)**
```
Current Habits Audit (15 minutes):
□ Map client's existing daily routines
□ Identify strong, consistent anchor habits
□ Note timing and location of potential anchor habits
□ Assess current habit environment and cues

New Habit Selection (15 minutes):
□ Choose 1-3 new habits to build (start with 1)
□ Define minimum viable version of each habit
□ Ensure habits align with client goals and values
□ Check that habits are behaviorally specific

Stack Design (15 minutes):
□ Match new habits with appropriate anchor habits
□ Create specific "After I... I will..." statements
□ Plan environmental setup to support new habits
□ Anticipate potential obstacles and solutions

Implementation Planning:
□ Start with one habit stack for first 2 weeks
□ Set up tracking system (calendar, app, journal)
□ Plan weekly check-ins and adjustments
□ Identify rewards and celebration strategies
```

**Habit Tracking and Adjustment**
```
Daily Tracking:
□ Simple yes/no tracking for each habit
□ Note context when habits are missed
□ Celebrate completion streaks
□ Adjust habit size if consistency drops below 80%

Weekly Review Questions:
• "Which habit stacks are working smoothly?"
• "What's getting in the way of consistency?"
• "How can we make the habit easier or more obvious?"
• "What environmental changes would help?"

Monthly Habit Evolution:
□ Assess which habits have become automatic
□ Consider increasing intensity or frequency
□ Add new habit stacks for established routines
□ Phase out tracking for fully automated habits

□ Have backup plans if framework isn't working

**During Framework Application:**
□ Explain framework to client and get buy-in
□ Remain flexible and responsive to client needs
□ Notice what's working and what isn't
□ Adjust approach based on client response
□ Stay focused on client outcomes rather than framework adherence

**After Framework Application:**
□ Assess effectiveness with client feedback
